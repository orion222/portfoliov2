    "overview": "A budget remake of the popular RPG game OMORI made by Orion Chen and Nicky Lam. This game is a 2D adventure game where you must explore your surroundings to proceed in the story. You will be controlling a character who is named SUNNY located in WHITESPACE and need to find a way to start the game. Once you begin the game, you are now a delusion of SUNNY named OMORI. Hover the lightbulb in the main menu for an easter egg. \n\nDedicated to Ms. Wong.",

    "overview": "A budget remake of the popular RPG game UNDERTALE made by Orion Chen and Nicky Lam. 2D sandbox game similar to UNDERTALE where the storyline progresses as you continue to explore. There are a couple settings in the game that you walk through and a functional battle just like in UNDERTALE (though there are only 2 attacks). The running animation kind of laggy since this was our first time experimenting with render rates and animation. Fixing it would be a whole lot of tuning small details, so it'll just be left as is. The movement in the next game we built (OMORI) is a MUCH smoother implementation."

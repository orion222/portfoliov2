Features include viewing, insertion, deletion, look-ups, printing, and more. Aside from the technology, this project was made with several software practices such as SCRUM for collaboration and Mockito for testing. <https://github.com/zsspan/|Zohair>, one of my group mates, made a much more detailed description of the project in his repo which is linked below.",

As you can imagine, coding this in MIPS Assembly was challenging and frustrating to debug. Plus the fact that we had to collaborate on a SINGLE file since assembly does not support modules. Thank goodness for high-level programming languages, but it's nice to know your roots. You can use <https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/index.htm|MARS> to run this program, make sure to read the comments at the top of tetris.asm for proper setup. ",

In this game you can walk around and interact with certain spots to collect items. When you walk to the end, you will fight a boss fight that features 2 different attacks in the same UNDERTALE style. Do note that the animations such as walking are much more laggy since this was our first experience of making a sandbox game. Our next project OMORI is a much smoother implementation of these animations.\n\nDedicated to Mr. Chow",
